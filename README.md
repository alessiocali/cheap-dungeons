## What's this?

Cheap dungeons is a tiny project made at the end of a 18-hours class about programming with Python. It features a simple procedural algorithm for planning the dungeon and a turn-based multiplayer mode to play with friends. The name comes from the cheap look of the command line interface. I, for one, find it charming. 

## What can I do with it?

Well, for one you can play it! Simply download this repository and run this inside the 'src' folder:

```
python cheap-dungeons.py
```

You will need to have Python 3.x installed and on your PATH variable. Please be aware that currently the game language is in Italian as I had no prior plan of realeasing it. It will be pretty easy to translate though, and I'll upload an English version sooner or later.

Other than that, you can fiddle with my code as you please. Comments, variables and methods are in English.

## Code an analysis and feedback

As with my other works, I'll eventually talk about this in my blog on game development. Please check it out for any feedback! You can find posts pertaining Cheap Dungeons here: http://g4f.altervista.org/tag/cheap-dungeons/
